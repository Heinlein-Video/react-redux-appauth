# React AppAuth
## About
Opinionated React component (AuthProvider) to provide OpenID Connect and OAuth2 protocol support. Has hooks :tada:
Heavily inspired by [oidc-react](https://github.com/bjerkio/oidc-react) but without the unmaintained oidc-client-js and redux-oidc.

Based on @openid/appauth-js.
